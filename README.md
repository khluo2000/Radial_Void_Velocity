MPhil project utilizing radial velocity statistics of cosmic voids to probe interacting dark energy within the Type 3 model. Using data from N-body simulations, Void catalogs were generated using the VIDE toolkit. I then developed custom codes to extract data from these catalogs to calculate void velocities.
